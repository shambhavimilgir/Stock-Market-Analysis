Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the volatile and complex nature of the financial markets. This project aims to predict the stock prices using machine learning techniques. The prediction will help investors make informed decisions about buying and selling stocks.

Objective:
1. Predict stock market trends based on historical data
2. Compare effectiveness of different models
3. Deploy the best performing model


Models Compared:
1. SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors)
2. GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
